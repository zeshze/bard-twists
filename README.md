Assuming you are twisting four songs at any given time:

**Caster group**:

- [Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity](https://wiki.project1999.com/Cassindra's_Chorus_of_Clarity) (as soon as it lands, play again)
- [Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity](https://wiki.project1999.com/Cassindra's_Chorus_of_Clarity) (as soon as it lands, back to Cantana)

**Tank group**: 

*Heavy magic resist w/ damage shield boost from MRR*

I've ordered this like this to promote what I think are the important things for supporting a tank:

- Resists (Guardian/Elemental Rhythms, Psalm of Mystic Shielding/Cooling/Warmth/Purity/Vitality)
- Damage Shield (McVaxius' Rousing Rondo, Psalm of Warmth/Cooling)
- AC (McVaxius' Rousing Rondo, Nix's Harmonic)
- *Potentially others*

**DPS group**:

Depending on the encounter and what resists are needed see above for songs one and two. Then depending on gear you could do the following for songs three and four:

- [McVaxius's Rousing Rondo](https://wiki.project1999.com/McVaxius'_Rousing_Rondo) (Attack Speed, STR, ATK, DS) - The benefit of this song is that it uses a brass instrument which means these stats increase quite a bit
- [Verses of Victory](https://wiki.project1999.com/Verses_of_Victory) (Attack Speed/AGI/AC/STR) - Downside to this song is that it is singing and you can't boost it's performance
- [Hymn of Restoration](https://wiki.project1999.com/Hymn_of_Restoration) - Straight heals homie
- [Cantana of Replenishment](https://wiki.project1999.com/Cantata_of_Replenishment)  - if your DPSers need a bit of healing and mana
