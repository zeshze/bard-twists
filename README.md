## DPS group

Depending on the encounter and what resists are needed see above for songs one and two. Then depending on gear you could do the following for songs three and four:

- [McVaxius's Rousing Rondo](https://wiki.project1999.com/McVaxius'_Rousing_Rondo) (Attack Speed, STR, ATK, DS) - The benefit of this song is that it uses a brass instrument which means these stats increase quite a bit
- [Verses of Victory](https://wiki.project1999.com/Verses_of_Victory) (Attack Speed/AGI/AC/STR) - Downside to this song is that it is singing and you can't boost it's performance
- [Composition of Ervaj](https://wiki.project1999.com/Composition_of_Ervaj) - If your DPSers are haste capped this likely won't be that beneficial. Plus you are missing out on nice stats that MRR or VoV provide.
- [Vilia's Chorus of Celerity](https://wiki.project1999.com/Vilia%27s_Chorus_of_Celerity) - If your DPSers are haste capped this likely won't be that beneficial. Plus you are missing out on nice stats that like MRR or VoV provide.
- [Hymn of Restoration](https://wiki.project1999.com/Hymn_of_Restoration) - Straight heals homie
- [Cantana of Replenishment](https://wiki.project1999.com/Cantata_of_Replenishment)  - If your DPSers need a bit of healing and mana

## General thoughts

I've ordered this like this to promote what I think are the important things for supporting melee of any kind. One/two are likely always resists. Next damage shield for tanks and attack boosts for melee. Followed by other supporting songs like AC for tanks or heals for DPS.

- Resists (Guardian/Elemental Rhythms, Psalm of Mystic Shielding/Cooling/Warmth/Purity/Vitality)
- Damage Shield/Attack (McVaxius' Rousing Rondo, Psalm of Warmth/Cooling, Verses of Victory, Composition of Ervaj, Vilia's Chorus of Celerity, etc.)
- AC/Heals (McVaxius' Rousing Rondo, Niv's Harmonic, Hymn of Restoration, Cantana of Replenishment, etc.)
- *Potentially others*
